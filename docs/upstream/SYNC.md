# Xtra synchronization

HexStream started from Xtra 2.60.7, commit [`a3cbb0325f3330573a6738f7d36a2c5b785f4d1c`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/a3cbb0325f3330573a6738f7d36a2c5b785f4d1c). Its initial public commit is a source snapshot rather than a shared-history Git fork. Compare against the recorded upstream checkpoint when integrating later changes.

## Current integrated checkpoint

HexStream **1.0.0-beta.5** retains all three upstream application changes through **Xtra 2.60.8**, commit [`96772030c7712581ad150c9b8b619c77a3527e50`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/96772030c7712581ad150c9b8b619c77a3527e50). Beta.4 improves settings explanations and beta.5 adds the [credited ThystTV chat adaptation](THYST-CHAT.md), without changing this Xtra checkpoint. HexStream keeps its own version, package and signing identity.

All three original changes below were authored by **crackededed** on October 14, 2026.

| Original upstream commit | Fix | HexStream adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`0497f3d2ca9085abd72102b609d3c6ef838bfee6`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/0497f3d2ca9085abd72102b609d3c6ef838bfee6) | Unlisted video qualities | Preserve upstream reason exclusions, optional metadata and resolution/frame-rate/bitrate ordering. Small shared functions allow deterministic JVM coverage. |
| [`b24b45c7b85b01d85d284eb51dbb964a8d3eea5d`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/b24b45c7b85b01d85d284eb51dbb964a8d3eea5d) | Player status-bar crash | Apply upstream `isAdded` guards to showing and hiding system bars. Existing minimize/swipe behavior remains in place. |
| [`96772030c7712581ad150c9b8b619c77a3527e50`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/96772030c7712581ad150c9b8b619c77a3527e50) | Channel-points context query | Update the persisted-query hash and `includeGoalTypes` in HexStream’s shared viewer-points request. Both the custom rewards panel and inherited bonus context use it. Redemption/claim mutations are unchanged. |

## Checks for this integration

- Run the JVM suites, including the intercepted HTTP request/response checks and unlisted-quality regressions.
- Run Android lint and build the optimized signed APK locally.
- Compile the isolated QA instrumentation fixtures; run the status-bar fixture on a connected test device when available.
- On a device, check live playback, minimize/restore and back navigation, quality selection/recovery, and loading points/rewards. Spend or claim points only intentionally.
- Confirm the existing pagination, filter, proxy and low-delay suites still pass. No changes to those implementations are required by this synchronization.

The machine-readable checkpoint is [SYNC.json](SYNC.json); update it alongside this record after integrating upstream changes.

Record actual results in [verification](../VERIFICATION.md). Compiling a fixture is not the same as running it, and a successful mocked response does not certify Twitch’s live API behavior.

## Future updates

Fetch `crackededed/Xtra` and review commits after the checkpoint above. Adapt changes in areas HexStream extends, preserve upstream attribution and licenses, run the relevant regression suites and build locally. Update this checkpoint only after incorporating all intended changes through the new commit. Do not replace HexStream’s customized source wholesale with an upstream tree.

Player/chat updates must also preserve floating chat's single existing fragment/connection, full-video layout, normalized bounds, minimize/PiP/portrait suppression and input docking, along with the existing swipe controls. Run both the geometry and isolated-view regressions when modifying those paths.

A completed update includes the tested source on the existing repository’s main branch and a downloadable GitHub release with the signed APK, matching source ZIP and SHA-256 checksums. Builds run locally. Preserve the package/signing identity, empty defaults, credits and published release tags. A failed check leaves the previous downloadable release in place.
