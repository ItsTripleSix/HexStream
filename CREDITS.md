# Credits and provenance

## Xtra comes first

**HexStream is built on Xtra.** It is not a Twitch client written from scratch.

- **Andrey Asadchy** created the original [AndreyAsadchy/Xtra](https://github.com/AndreyAsadchy/Xtra).
- **crackededed and Xtra contributors** continued development in [crackededed/Xtra](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra), the upstream used here.
- **TripleSix** maintains the HexStream customization and branding.

The starting source is Xtra **2.60.7**, upstream commit [`a3cbb0325f3330573a6738f7d36a2c5b785f4d1c`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/a3cbb0325f3330573a6738f7d36a2c5b785f4d1c). The public HexStream branch begins with a source snapshot; upstream author history remains available in those linked repositories. The original upstream README is retained in [docs/upstream/README-Xtra.md](docs/upstream/README-Xtra.md).

Beta.3 incorporates **crackededed’s Xtra 2.60.8 fixes**, through upstream commit [`96772030c7712581ad150c9b8b619c77a3527e50`](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra/commit/96772030c7712581ad150c9b8b619c77a3527e50). The [upstream synchronization record](docs/upstream/SYNC.md) links each original commit and describes adaptations for HexStream.

Xtra provides the app architecture and much of the player, Twitch integration, chat, emote support, browsing, VOD/clip handling, downloads, saved content, themes and settings. HexStream’s changes focus on category pagination, global content controls, saved-account switching, global proxy presets, live-delay tuning, gestures, points/reward handling, reliability and branding.

## Filtering inspiration: Unwanted Twitch

**[Unwanted Twitch by kwaschny](https://github.com/kwaschny/unwanted-twitch)** inspired HexStream’s channel/category/title/tag blocking workflow and compatible blocking-list JSON format. Credit belongs to its author and contributors for establishing that approach.

HexStream implements its own native Android filtering engine. The separate [HexStream Filter browser extension](https://github.com/OnlyTripleSix/HexStream-Filter) is also independently implemented and credits Unwanted Twitch’s inspiration and format. No Unwanted Twitch source code or artwork is bundled in either project.
